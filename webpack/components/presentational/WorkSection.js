              For GM customers, we created a dynamic app for Android and iPhone
              that allows them to select the right car based on their
              lifestyle. This app also enables access to car loans provided by
              GM Financial Services.
              <br />
              <br />
              For GM, it became a powerful tool to provide in-the-moment data to
              the Salesforce. Equipped with our hyper-location technology,
              customer are given a personalized experience according to their
              previous activity and interest. Sales reps receive relevant
              information about the customer in real-time, such as the type of
              the vehicle they are interested in, the number of visits and the
              status of their car loan application. This empowers the sales team
              with relevant data to provide a customer experience that has never
              been done before.
